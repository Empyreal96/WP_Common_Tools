# Windows Phone Common Tools
Compilable source of most .NET based tools and libraries from the Windows Phone Common Tools package (Windows 10 Kits). 

- Referenced together to allow files to work together (If you use a custom exe with a stock library from the Kits you will get mismatched assembly error)
- I use a different folder to the default settings for my Windows Phone Common Tools install, you may need to reference the location to files from YOUR kit if needed (Only a couple files will need changed)
- Based from old decompiled source [IUTools Components Decompiled](https://github.com/Empyreal96/IUTool_components_decompiled)
- Used ILSpy to decompile the binaries
- Targets .NET Framework 4.6 with VS2019
